🗿 **Hello! I'm Cheeto.**<br>
I'm a french self taught web developer born in 2004. I'm interested in a lot of things such as design 🖼️, music 🎷, computer science 💻...
I mostly develop in **Javascript**, but I can code in *Python* and a little bit of *C#* (Don't quote me, I ain't a pro in it.)
** **
I can speak English, French, a bit of German and I'm currently learning Danish by myself! 👍<br>
The projects published here are mostly ideas I had, or computer science class projects I decided to publish, you can check them if you are interested. 🧊
