But you can also call me `Martin`. I am a French student born in 2004 and living in Alsace. I am currently studying web development and a lot of other things so I can maybe become a fullstack web developer.

## My interests:
- Computer Science 💻
- Design 🖼️
- Music Making 🎷
- Video Games 🕹️
- And lots of others!

## I can program in:
- **Javascript**: It is the language I use the most in my projects.
- **HTML and CSS**: The basics for web development.
- **Python**: I mostly learned it during high school in programming classes.
- **PHP**: I am still learning it right now in my university.
- And a little bit of **C#**: Tried it a little to make a Video Game on UNITY.

## I can speak in:
- **French**, of course, it is my native language.
- **English**, the second language I use the most throughout my day.
- I can speak basic **German**, I like the language but it's not the language I focus the most right now.
- And I am learning **Danish**, I love this one.
